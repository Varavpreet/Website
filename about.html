    <h2>My Backrground</h2>
    <p> Although i am presently living in Calgary, alberta, I am an Indian.Consequently, I have been a quiet and
        introverted student at my school from the beginning. Even though everyone says i have a friendly nature, it
        takes me a while to establish acquaintances. I'm from Kapurthala, Punjab, India.The city is also known as the
        city of palaces. In terms of my school, it was a memorable time. the school years were the memorable ones. I
        made the decision to come to Canada for my post high school education after graduating from high school. I
        believe that it was one of the best decisions of my life.
    </p>
    <h3>Life after deciding to move to Canada</h3>
    <p>
        My family in India, both then and today, has supported me in my choice to leave my home country and begin a new
        life. I began getting ready for my trip to come to Canada, beginning with the application procedure for a visa.
        My family was somewhat concerned about my ability to manage all those things on my own when I recieved my visa.
        Outside of my microcosm, though, the most incredible experience has been being independent and building a
        prosperous life that I have chosen.

        Since my arrival in August 2023, Canada has presented me a plethora of novel experiences and obstacles.

        variety of situations has also altered.

        successful careers in terms of careers. Without a doubt, I would like to learn more about the software industry.
        Because of my innate love of solving problems and the dynamic nature of the industry, I want to work as a
        software developer. I'm fascinated by the excitement of coming up with original ideas, never stopping to learn,
        and making a positive impact on the world community. My interest in this sector stems from the possibility of
        turning concepts into real-world applications as well as the freedom and business potential it provides. I am
        drawn to the cooperative and varied work atmosphere that promotes innovation and friendship, above and beyond
        the monetary benefits.I'm excited to have a significant effect in the rapidly changing field of software
        development by taking on the difficulties and being on the cutting edge of technology.
    </p>

        In addition to all of this, I presently work part-time, and while I'm in school, I would want to land an
        entry-level position that would help me succeed in the development industry. I've included my resume for any
        part-time positions.
